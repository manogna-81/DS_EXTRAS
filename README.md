# DS_EXTRAS
Write a python code which will take the number of people n and return the probability value p,0≤p≤1 with which can claim that at least two people in the room will have the same birthday.  Assume that there are 365 days in a year. Please put the code in a loop so that we can enter different values of n without exiting.
Also for each value of n from 1 to 400 find the value of p using your code and plot the same (using python libraries) as a graph. n will be on the X-axis and p will be on the Y-axis.
